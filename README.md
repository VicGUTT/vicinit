# Personal fun tool to quickly scaffold projects

This "project scaffolder" is meant for personal use; it contains no tests, hasn't been tested on other systems than Windows and applies my own coding conventions and styles.

## Installation

_Nope, not needed._

## Usage

**First** create a folder **and** `cd` into it, **then** run the following command:

```bash
npx @vicgutt/vicinit
```

or

```bash
npx @vicgutt/vicapp
```

From there simply answer the questions asked and choose the template to scaffold.

## Templates

So far, only one template is included: `ts-lib`.

The _ts-lib_ template is meant for creating "public TypeScript libraries that will eventually be published to NPM with a MIT license".

Other templates for _Laravel + TypeScript + Tailwind_ and _Vue + TypeScript + Tailwind_ should follow at some point.
